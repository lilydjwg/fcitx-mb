A tool for interactively viewing and modifying [fcitx](http://code.google.com/p/fcitx/)'s code tables.

It's for fcitx4 only. For fcitx5, see [fcitx5-tabledict](https://github.com/lilydjwg/fcitx5-tabledict).

Be sure to backup before use this to modify a code table file; there may be some bugs.

The Python version is safer and more friendly than this one, but also much slower.
