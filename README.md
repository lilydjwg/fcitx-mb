A tool for interactively viewing and modifying [fcitx](http://code.google.com/p/fcitx/)'s code tables.

Be sure to backup before use this to modify a code table file; there may be some bugs.

There is a [Python version one](https://github.com/lilydjwg/winterpy/tree/master/pyexe/pymb3) which is safer and more friendly than this one, but also much slower.
